# Flex Panel Gallery

## Objective: 
- Working with CSS3 flex box
- Flex box layouts consist of a flex container which contain flex items
- In this file, I use a panels class as the flex container, and the panel class as the flex items
- Flex items are only as wide as they need to be in order to display their contents, but we want them to take up the entire flex container
- Allow the flex items to take up equal space and fill out the flex container by allowing them to grow 
- JavaScript code to attach event listeners to each panel element that will fire when an panel is clicked on and call their respective event handlers
- One event handler function will adjust the size of the panel, and the other will be responsible for bringing in the p elements that we pushed off earlier
